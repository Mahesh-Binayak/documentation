# Test Automation

We implemented three specialized test rigs for automation testing in MOSIP. The UI test rig ensures thorough validation of web-based application modules, including AdminUI, PMPUI, and ResidentUI.&#x20;

The Domain-Specific Language (DSL) test rig facilitates end-to-end testing of MOSIP functionalities like Registration and Authentication. Additionally, the API test rig rigorously tests all MOSIP APIs, covering various corner cases for enhanced reliability.
