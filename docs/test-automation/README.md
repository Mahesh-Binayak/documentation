# ðŸ‘¾ Test Automation

We implemented three specialized test rigs for automation testing in MOSIP Identity. The UI test rig ensures thorough validation of web-based application modules, including Admin UI, PMP UI, and Resident UI.

The Domain-Specific Language (DSL) test rig facilitates end-to-end testing of MOSIP functionalities like Registration and Authentication. Additionally, the API test rig rigorously tests all MOSIP APIs, covering various corner cases for enhanced reliability.
