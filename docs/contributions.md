IIIT Bangalore has been home to MOSIP since its inception in 2018 and the students of the institute have been at the forefront of the MOSIPâ€™s community-led development. The students have on an ongoing basis contributed to solving engineering problems in MOSIP for real-world applications. Their major ongoing contributions include:

**Project 1:** Reporting framework for real-time streaming of data and visualization. The dashboards give a visual display of metrics and important data to track the status of various pre and post-enrollment processes. Reporting framework involves setting up the data pipeline for populating data from the database to ElasticSearch. 

A set of reference dashboards were also created as a part of this work.
 
**Project 2:** Registration officers/operators use the registration client application to enroll residents into the ID system. It is a thick client which works on machines with Windows OS. 

Students have contributed to the development of Android equivalent of the Registration Client, which can be installed on Android tablets.
